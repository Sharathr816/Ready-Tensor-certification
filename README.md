# Project 1 - Money Bot (A Simple RAG Chatbot)

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using LangChain, Groq LLMs, and ChromaDB. The chatbot has been implemented with a chain-based design, where document retrieval, context assembly, and response generation are structured into clear, sequential steps. 
It is designed to answer questions based on the books related to money and finance by retrieving relevant passages from the text, feeding them through the chain, and generating human-like, contextual answers.

The project is beginner-friendly and structured for easy setup.
(This project dosen't implement session-based memory, intermediate reasoning steps, basic logging or observability features)

## üìñ Example Usage
### Example 1
User: *"How do I make good money + have more time to enjoy doing what i love?"*

Bot: *"Let's talk about making good money and having more time to enjoy doing what you love. I think we can all agree that's a pretty sweet combo.

First, having flexibility is key. It allows you to wait for good opportunities, learn new skills, and find your passion at your own pace. Think of it like having a buffer zone in life. When most people are stressing about meeting deadlines and chasing competitors, you can take a step back, breathe, and focus on what really matters.

Now, let's talk about using your money to buy time and options. It's not just about accumulating wealth; it's about creating a lifestyle that gives you the freedom to pursue your passions. Think about it like this: if you're making a lot of money but working long hours, are you really enjoying the fruits of your labor? Probably not.

The key is to find a balance between making good money and having time to enjoy it. And that's where passion comes in. If you're passionate about what you do, you'll be more motivated to put in the work, even when things get tough. And that's when the magic happens ‚Äì you'll be able to weather the ups and downs of life and come out on top.

So, what's the takeaway? It's not just about making good money; it's about creating a lifestyle that allows you to enjoy the things that bring you joy. And that's a recipe for happiness.

**Good actions to take:**

1. **Save money** to create a buffer zone in life.
2. **Invest in yourself** by learning new skills and finding your passion.
3. **Use your money to buy time and options**, not just accumulate wealth.
4. **Find a balance between making good money and having time to enjoy it**.
5. **Pursue your passions** with purpose and motivation.*

### Example 2

User: "I want to be an expert in Agentic AI, should i take the course from ready tensor??"
